## introduction

The task is to sum the multiples of 3 and 5 under a number. 

A test case is given, the sum of multiples of these primes is 23.

## Extending the test

The given test of numbers to 10 missed an important case.  we should extend the number to 30 to include the case where a number is a multiple of 3 and 5.

numbers up to 30

multiples of 3 = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]
multiples of 5 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

30 is a good test case as it demonstrates two principles.  Firstly the inclusion of 15 twice, and secondly the non inclusion of 30 as its under the top of both.
