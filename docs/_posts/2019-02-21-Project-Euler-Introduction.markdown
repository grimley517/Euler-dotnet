# Introduction

This is a brain reawakening project.  Having just spent a fortnight in a hospital I'm revisiting the Euler problems using the dotnet core framework on a Mac.  I'm challengingmyself by going much more barebones than normal

- No Visual studio
- An editor (atom)
- Command line terminal.

## Notes

The answers in this project are not checked against the Project Euler site, I lost my login, and am not really that interested in validating the answers automatically.  

There may well be mistakes in this project, this is a learning journey.  If you are using this to "cheat" on some academic course I'm going to stop you. If you found this, chances are your lecturer will too. Please feel free to quote me using this websites URL.

## Aims

To provide solutions to project Euler problems 1-10, using a barebones development environment.
